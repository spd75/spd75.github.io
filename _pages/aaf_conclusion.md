As we mentioned, we didn’t expect our original idea of creating a rhythm-based game by listening to the audio of a song to be so infeasible. This certainly was disappointing and fell short of our expectations, but we felt like we were able to pivot appropriately and still finalize a very appealing project. We felt this was our only main shortcoming and thought that the rest of our implementation was on-par with our vision. However, if we did have to pick something to improve on, we would say that next time we would spend more time trying to synthesize different types of instruments other than a simple synth. We think it would be very cool to allow the user to pick between a piano, guitar, flute, etc. However, based off previous attempts, we understand that synthesizing these instruments may prove to be a significant challenge and is really only feasible with a more long-term project. Overall, we are very satisfied with the results of our game and think it is a fun game to play and show our friends!

### Standards
The only standards for us to follow were the frame rate of our graphics and sampling rate of our audio. The traditional standard for video tends to be 30FPS, and we played our game at 32.5 FPS. The traditional standard for audio synthesis is 44.1 kHz–we used 44 kHz which is close enough to claim.

### Intellectual Property Considerations
As for IP, we have mentioned on several other pages of this site that we:
* Used the vga graphics library from class to display our game on a VGA monitor
* Were inspired by the DDS code written for lab 2
* Were inspired by the previous layout of Whack-a-Mole
* Used public domain music (with the exception of the Beattle’s song which we said we would remove)
