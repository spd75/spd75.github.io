### Appendix E - References
Insperation for our laser cut and button design came from the Whack-a-Button project from last year. We also used the same buttons they used. Their website can be found here.

Insperation for direct digital synthesis code can be found 
[DDS Example in Code](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/blob/master/Lab_1/Audio_Beep_Synthesis/multitest.c)

We used the Pico SDK. This can be found here:
[RP2040 Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)

We used VGA driver for VGA communication between the RP2040 and the VGA monitor. More information about that can be found here:
[VGA Driver](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/VGA/VGA.html)

We used the RP2040 datasheet. This can be found here:
[RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf)

We used DAC datasheet. This can be found here:
[MCP4802/4812/4822 Datasheet](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Cricket/DAC.pdf)

We used the C SDK guide. This can be found here:
